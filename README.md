# Project Ideas

In this assignment, we will get a head start on our projects. You will describe three
potential project ideas and evaluate the suitability of each as a project.
You will also provide feedback on someone else's project idea.

The goals are this project are to (a) start getting a sense of what makes for a
good project and (b) start generating ideas for your project.

There are many different kinds of successful projects. To get a sense of what
counts as a good project--and for some ideas on generating projects of your
own--read this article on [how to generate project ideas][projectgen].

## Teamwork and collaboration

Do this assignment individually: you must come up with and describe your ideas
on your own. You may talk with other people, though, as you're generating ideas
and describing them. If you're inspired by someone else's idea, that's totally
fine! The two of you can write about the same idea (or that person can give you
an idea). But once you decide you both like the idea, don't talk about it with
each other until you've finished describing it. (That way, each of you can
contribute your unadulterated thoughts.)

## Comments / advice

- Have fun! This is your chance to play with the idea of language and perhaps
  come up with something that is both surprising and obvious.

- There's no commitment: You are not promising to do any of these things for
  the project (although it is certainly nice if you come up with an idea that
  you really like and that makes for a good project). You have until a little after
  Spring Break to settle on an idea for a project, so take your time.

- Read over the [project generation][projectgen] page right away. If you
  have some ideas, jot them down. Then let things percolate in your head for a
  couple of days before writing them up.

- Focus most of your attention for now on problems, rather than solutions. In
  particular--in most cases--it's premature to talk about an internal _vs_
  external language, compiled _vs_ interpreted, or choice of host language.
  Instead, focus on the need that a language would address and why a _language_
  helps address that need.

## Your three ideas

You will come up with four (potential) project ideas and write about them. Three
of the ideas are free-form, one is subject to constraints:

1.  **Free-range idea #1:** No constraints on this idea--it's all you!
    Describe this idea in `free-1.md`.

1.  **Free-range idea #2:** No constraints on this idea--it's all you!
    Describe this idea in `free-2.md`.

1.  **Interview ideaa:** Interview someone else who has expertise in a particular domain.
    They need not be programmers — it is probably best if they aren't — but it is okay if
    you end up interviewing a programmer / computer scientist. To come up with an idea, use
    some of the techniques from the beginning of the semester: interviewing, unpacking,
    finding inferences, creating a POV statement, domain analysis, etc. You do not need to
    perfectly follow all of the steps as we have done them in class; but try to follow as
    much of this process as possible, so that you arrive at something that addresses
    something of interest to the person you intereviewed. Ultimately, describe your idea in
    `interview.md`.

In each of the files mentioned above, you will find the same set of prompts.
Do not erase anything from the starter file, and fill it in with your ideas and
your thoughtful and well-written responses to the prompts. **Be sure to answer
every question in each file**.

You are free to take ideas from existing DSLs, past projects, or other
people, as long as you give credit and as long as your description and
evaluation of the idea are your own. However, taking _all_ your inspiration from
the same source (e.g., existing DSLs or from other people) is not advised.

## Grading

Good responses will:

- fully respond to every prompt in the starter file, _and_
- be well-written and easy to read, i.e., clear yet concise using good
  spelling, grammar, organization, and proper formatting, to convey a
  well-formed idea, _and_
- where appropriate, support your thoughts with references to material from
  class, from the domain of your project, or from other solutions in the same
  domain.

Great responses will additionally:

- be particularly insightful about the needs of the user and about the
  suitability of the idea as a CS 111 project ("insightful" means that you've
  clearly articulated all the angles, the benefits and drawbacks, risks, etc.),
  _or_
- describe a particularly novel use of language to solve a problem (e.g.,
  something that no one has thought of before), _or_
- provide a fourth idea whose description would receive a "Good" (to do so, create
  a new file with a name of your choosing, copy the questions into that file,
  answer the questions, and commit and push the file to your repository).

## Critiques

After the submission deadline, read over and comment on your
[critique partners'][teams] work. Be sure to comment on each of their ideas.

Here are some suggestions for critiques:

- What do you like about their idea(s)?
- Was there a need that was similar to one you thought of? If so, how are
  your thoughts about the problems similar to and different from your partners?
- Do you know anything about this domain? Do you know of existing DSLs that
  they didn't mention or do you have some expertise thinking about or writing
  programs for this domain? How might your experience augment your partner's
  thoughts on the domain?
- Answer the questions about suitability, scope, etc. of the project.
